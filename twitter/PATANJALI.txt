Sensex Today | Stock Market LIVE Updates | Page Industries Q2 Results: Profit after Tax at Rs. 150.3 cr, down 7.3% YoY; EBITDA at Rs 233.5 cr

Page Industries - Firstly a stock should not correct till major swing lows or the key support as it signifies weakness. The next thing to check is if it is able to reach the high again or else it will result in H&S top playing out. One thing for sure - a lot of time waste in here

Bad things happen below 200 SMA.  Page Industries highest ever fall in single day since 2009.   Down over 15% on bad results.  on never buy a stock below 200 SMA  https://twitter.com/aartirohra9/status/1619668593607860227?s=20â€¦ #moneymileventures #StockMarket #stocks

Page Industries   Poor set of numbers!   1. Sales down 13% YOY  2. PAT down 63% YOY  3. Negative Cash flow from operations in FY23 (driven by big jump in inventories)   Top-line decline with increase in inventory is not good news. Stock still at 80X earnings.
