Based on the provided technical indicators, the stock can be sold. Here's the justification for this recommendation:

1. RSI (Relative Strength Index): The current RSI value is 71.76, indicating that the stock is in an overbought condition. A value above 70 typically suggests that the stock is due for a price correction.

2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD line is at 98.81, which is higher than the MACD signal line of 71.53. This positive difference indicates a bullish momentum in the stock. However, since the stock is already overbought according to RSI, it is advisable to consider selling.

3. ADX (Average Directional Index): The ADX value is 36.84, indicating a strong bullish trend. However, it's important to note that the ADX+DI and ADX-DI values are 34.29 and 8.93, respectively. The ADX-DI value being relatively low suggests a weakening trend. Considering the stock's overbought condition and weakening trend, selling would be a prudent choice.

4. Stochastic Oscillator: The Stoch.K value is 95.36 and the Stoch.D value is 91.47, both of which are above 80 (overbought territory). This further reinforces the notion that the stock is overbought and due for a potential reversal.

Therefore, considering the overbought conditions indicated by RSI and Stochastic Oscillator, as well as the weakening trend suggested by ADX, it is recommended to sell the stock.
