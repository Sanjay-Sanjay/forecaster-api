1. RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI is 63.84075873, which indicates that the stock is not overbought or oversold. It is relatively close to the overbought threshold of 70. Therefore, no clear buying or selling signal can be derived from the RSI alone. It suggests the stock can be held.

2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD line is positive at 6.81931271, while the signal line is negative at -6.04038997. This indicates a potential bullish signal as the MACD line has crossed above the signal line. It suggests the stock can be bought.
