However, the previous RSI value was 63.66, suggesting that there has been a slight increase in buying pressure. This indicates a possible continuation of the upward momentum. It might be prudent to hold the stock at the moment.

2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD line is currently at 268.24, while the signal line is at 238.77. The positive MACD line suggests that the stock has bullish momentum.
