4. ROC (Rate of Change): The current rate of change is 33.199996, indicating positive momentum. An ROC value above zero suggests a positive trend. Therefore, this suggests that the stock can be bought or held.

5. Stochastic Oscillator: The current Stochastic %K value is 70.51708649 and the %D value is 77.2231758. The %K crossing above the %D is considered a bullish signal, indicating a potential buying opportunity. Therefore, this suggests that the stock can be bought or held.
