1. RSI: The current RSI value is 57.90, which is above the RSI[1] value of 53.25. This indicates that the stock is in a slightly overbought condition. However, it is not significantly overbought. Based on this, the stock can be held or bought but not sold.

2. MACD: The MACD histogram is negative, with a value of 120.34, and the MACD signal line is also negative, with a value of 137.89. This suggests that the stock is currently in a downtrend. Based on this, the stock should be sold rather than bought or held.

3. ADX: The ADX value is 20.03, which is below the threshold of 25. This indicates that the stock is not in a strong trend. Therefore, it is not suitable for making a definite buy or sell decision based on ADX alone. It can be held or further analyzed with other indicators.
