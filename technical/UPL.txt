   - ADX-DI: 25.73
   - Previous ADX+DI: 13.69
   - Previous ADX-DI: 26.85
   - Interpretation: The ADX is below 25, indicating a weak trend. The ADX+DI is greater than the ADX-DI, suggesting a potential bullish signal.

The MACD and Stochastic Oscillator show bearish signals with negative values and oversold conditions. However, the ADX indicates a weak trend with a potential bullish signal.

Therefore, considering these technical indicators alone, the stock can be held, but caution is advised due to the conflicting signals. Further analysis including fundamental factors and other indicators is recommended for a comprehensive decision.
