Based on the provided technical indicators, here is an analysis of the stock:

RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI is currently at 72.38, which indicates an overbought condition. This suggests that the stock may be due for a reversal or correction. Therefore, it may be wise to consider selling the stock.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD line is currently at 10.18, while the signal line is at 6.45. The positive value of the MACD line indicates that the stock is bullish.

Therefore, it may be wise to consider selling the stock.

In summary, based on the technical indicators provided, it is suggested to sell the stock due to an overbought condition indicated by the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator.
