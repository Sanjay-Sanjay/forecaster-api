Based on the given technical indicators, let's analyze each one and determine whether the stock can be bought, sold, or held:

1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - The current RSI value is 64.32, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. However, compared to the previous RSI value of 60.66, it has increased, indicating bullish momentum. Therefore, the stock can be held or bought, but potential overbought conditions should be monitored.

2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - The MACD line is currently at 64.89, while the signal line is at 63.46. The positive MACD line suggests a bullish signal. Therefore, the stock can be held or bought.

3. ADX (Average Directional Index) - The current ADX value is 31.34, above the threshold of 25, indicating a trend. However, the ADX+DI and ADX-DI values are 28.99 and 13.62 respectively, suggesting a weak trend. Therefore, the stock can be held, but a cautious approach is advisable.

4. ROC (Rate of Change) - The current ROC value is 191.5, which indicates a significant positive momentum. Therefore, the stock can be held or bought.

5. Stochastic Oscillator - The Stochastic K and D values are 77.15 and 72.23 respectively, both above the threshold of 70. This indicates that the stock is in overbought territory and may experience a potential reversal. Therefore, it might be a good time to sell or hold the stock and wait for a potential pullback.

Considering the above analysis, the stock can be held or bought based on the RSI, MACD, ADX, and ROC indicators. However, the Stochastic Oscillator suggests potential overbought conditions, so it might be advisable to sell or hold and wait for a potential pullback.
