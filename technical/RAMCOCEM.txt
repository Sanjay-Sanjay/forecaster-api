1. RSI (Relative Strength Index):
   - Current RSI: 61.98
   - Previous RSI: 62.36

   The RSI is above 50, indicating positive momentum in the stock. However, it is not yet in the overbought zone (above 70). Therefore, based on the RSI alone, the stock can be held or bought.

2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):
   - MACD Line: 43.04
   - Signal Line: 15.14

   The MACD Line is above the Signal Line, suggesting bullish momentum in the stock. The positive MACD value indicates a potential buying opportunity. Therefore, based on the MACD, the stock can be bought.

3. ADX (Average Directional Index):
   - ADX: 18.86
   - ADX+DI: 27.22
   - ADX-DI: 15.03

   - %K: 88.73
   - %D: 87.78
   - Previous %K: 89.60
