Based on the provided technical indicators, the stock can be sold. Here is the justification for this recommendation:

1. RSI (Relative Strength Index): The current RSI value is 87.39, which is extremely high and indicates that the stock is overbought. This suggests that the stock may be due for a downward correction or a potential reversal. Therefore, it is advisable to sell the stock.

2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD consists of two separate lines, the MACD line and the signal line. The current MACD line value is 199.64, while the signal line value is 155.22. The positive difference between the two lines suggests that the stock is in a bullish trend. However, considering the overbought conditions indicated by other indicators, it would be prudent to sell the stock.

3. ADX (Average Directional Index): The current ADX value is 66.64. A value above 25 indicates a strong trend, but it is important to note that the ADX does not differentiate between bullish and bearish trends. The ADX+DI value is 51.17, indicating a positive directional movement, which could suggest a bullish trend. However, the ADX-DI value is 6.53, indicating a weaker negative directional movement. Given the discrepancy between the two, it is advisable to sell the stock.

4. ROC (Rate of Change): The current ROC value is 640.93, which represents a significant increase compared to the previous period. The high positive ROC suggests that the stock has experienced a substantial increase in price. This could indicate an overbought condition, supporting the sell recommendation.

5. Stochastic Oscillator: The Stochastic K and D values are at 90.55 and 91.18, respectively, which are both very high and close to the upper limit of 100. This indicates that the stock is in overbought territory and could be due for a reversal or a downward correction. Therefore, it is advisable to sell the stock based on this indicator.

Considering all the above indicators, it is recommended to sell the stock given the overbought conditions indicated by RSI, ADX, and Stochastic Oscillator, as well as the significant increase in price indicated by the ROC.
